          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>After gaining knowledge from multiple sources, I philosophically believe there are two roles to being a software engineer. First, the facilitator is someone who helps everyone do their best work together by creating a psychologically safe and involving environment to collaborate on, then the developer is someone who translates the team's best work into a desirable, realistic, and measurable product. I value honest conversations and progressive thinking, and I aim to create things that empower and inspire.</p>
          <br /><p>My soft skills include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Agility</li>
              <li>Critical thinking</li>
              <li>Adaptability</li>
              <li>Team work</li>
              <li>Time management</li>
          </ul>
